# Subsurface wireframes:

### I used [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc) to create the initial design mockups for this project. This tool allowed me to quickly and efficiently plan the layout and structure of the different device views.

## Desktop:

- For the desktop layout, the design is streamlined and utilizes Bootstrap's responsive grid system. The content is organized in a clean and intuitive manner, with elements positioned side-by-side to make efficient use of the available screen space.

## Tablet:

- On the tablet view, the design remains similar to the desktop version, but with some key adjustments to accommodate the smaller screen size. The main difference is that the buttons, which were previously displayed side-by-side, are now stacked on top of each other. This layout change ensures the content remains easily accessible and the user experience is optimized for tablet sizes.

## Mobile:

- On the mobile version, I haven't implemented the design for every single page, as the overall structure is  similar. The mobile layout follows the same approach as the tablet, but with all elements being set to `col-12` instead of `col-4`. This ensures the content is easily accessible and the user experience is optimized, with larger images and buttons for better usability.
