## The Idea:

* "Subsurface" is your gateway to the underground music scene, offering the ultimate destination for underground music events and ticket sales across the UK's major cities. Our focus lies on the raw, unfiltered sounds of techno, house, noise, and experimental music. While countless event websites exist, none truly cater to the authentic underground scene. Subsurface fills that void, bringing you closer to the music that matters.

* Whether you're a devoted fan of the underground or a curious newcomer, Subsurface provides an unparalleled selection of events often overlooked by mainstream platforms. Join us and immerse yourself in the vibrant, pulsating heart of the UK's underground music culture.

* "Subsurface" is developed as my Milestone Project 4 for the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. This project incorporates a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and PostgreSQL. Multiple Django apps were used to structure the application effectively, and Stripe integration was implemented to handle secure ticket transactions.
